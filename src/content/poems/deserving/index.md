hate me, i deserve it

fight me, i deserve it

cut me, i deserve it

kill me, i deserve it

choke me, i deserve it

rape me, i deserve it

hold me, i deserve it

caress me, i deserve it

care for me, i deserve it

love me, i deserve it

make love to me, i deserve it

im worthy of all the things i deserve

the world treats me like marble but i am clay

each stroke of the chisel changes my form, and i put up no resistance to it

fired and solidified, how could a cracked vessel ever hold water?

self love is kintsugi for the mind;;;

it is possible to become whole again,

but never to prevent the next crack
