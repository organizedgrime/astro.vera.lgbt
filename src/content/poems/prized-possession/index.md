reduced to that which i am not,

shown a mirror with no face,

stripped of all personhood,

i saw just how beautiful an object i really am.

you showed me this mirror, held it up to the place with no face, and i gazed deeply at my angles and facets.

knowing this beauty,

trusting your covet for it,

i’ve never felt safer than i did in your vault.

but now.

you’ve found something shinier.

are her facets more precise? 

is her geometry more entrancing?

do you prefer the way you look in her reflection?

a gemstone, i have no mouth with which to voice these fears.

instead, i am lifted from my resting place with far less care and with far more haste than i was put there.

this gemstone no longer suits the collection.

i am no longer her prized possession.

a gemstone can not adorn itself.

a gemstone should adore itself.

i’m unsure if you ever knew my true beauty.
