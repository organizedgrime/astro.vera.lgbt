you said that you loved me,

you said i was yours,

is this what you say

to all of your whores?

i gave you my all,

i can never take back.

in retrospect,

this feels like attack.

now on the sideline,

i watch you repeat

all of our love

with the first girl you meet.

but you knew her well,

nay, better than i.

she was your muse;

i was merely your fly.

and now as i twitch

alone in this web,

im filled with remorse

youâ€™ve not eaten my head.

how could i have been

so young and naive,

to trust in your words,

to trust in your weave?

each of my limbs,

they want to give out,

but i have no choice,

i. must. get. out.
