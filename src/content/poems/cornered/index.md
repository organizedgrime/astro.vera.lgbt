thinner than an atom

ive watched

as an iron needle

flew straight through the sun.

ive watched

as tongues speak

as minds hear

and ive not noticed myself threaded.

how carefully

its eye must be prepared

to weave such delicate webs

around my neurons

my manifolds.

i cant remove this thread

not without 

splintering.

and yet i am grateful 

to witness a master at work.

i shed blood in my mind

every

time

i

see

the

truth.

there is no escape from escape

there is no integrity in our abode

there is nowhere to call home

when even the void

does not welcome us.
