theres always a pebble in my shoe

i dont know how it got there

but it never hurts until i stare;

and then i cant stop staring

&emsp;&emsp;recently i found another,

&emsp;&emsp;jabbing at my toes,

&emsp;&emsp;piercing my flesh;

&emsp;&emsp;this is fine, i suppose.

other people have pebbles too

different shapes and sizes

so why am i so ashamed?

to walk with a limp?

anxieties voiced,

fears assuaged,

boundaries communicated,

even side pieces deserve that much.

hold me close,

make me feel loved,

shower me in flowers and kisses from above.

benevolence overflowing, even a doll like me gets a hug.

maybe you shouldâ€™ve communicated

that we would stop communicating.

people only want what they cant have
