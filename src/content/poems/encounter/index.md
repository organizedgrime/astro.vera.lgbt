fire in those eyes

a crisp white fire

a fire so bright

<br/>

that i can’t meet that gaze

i’m far too weak, 

to take that pain away

<br/>

there are strata of suffering

which ___ are unaware of

_____ we don’t have words for,

nor should we

<br/>

terror

hot in my veins

let me out of this flesh,

&emsp;&emsp;*now.*

<br/>

suddenly you’re not just in my head.

<br/>

you have horns

you don’t sleep

you don’t want me to either

<br/>

taller than i expected.

<br/>

i cannot mute ______s that are not spoken with sound.

i cannot unsee 

what i never chose to see.

<br/>

i wrote down one fear,

and it was you.

<br/>

and yet.

the primal fear

of your shadowy form

melts like ghee

in the flame of deeper horror

as i come to realize

the flame in those eyes

is the moon’s

and in mine,

the sun’s.

<br/>

sometimes echoes only get louder.
