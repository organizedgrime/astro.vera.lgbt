This article is targeted towards an audience that wants to deeply understand how real world Astronomy directly results in the divinatory information read by Astrologers around the globe. This is primarily presented in a mathematical and conceptual framework, but some components require pseudocode to be understood in their modern praxis. 
<br/>
As part of my creation of the IOS App Familiar Spirit, I created an Astronomy / Astrology math library from scratch in Swift. Doing so took a great deal of research, conceptualization, and code. The fruits of that labor are condensed for you here.
<br/>
No prior knowledge of Astronomy is assumed, so this article is very verbose. I encourage you to digest it in parts, even taking your own notes. 
<br/>
Great inspiration in diagramming has been pulled from The Elements of House Division by Ralph William Holden, a masterful work of Astrology math that has been largely forgotten by contemporary Astrologers. I was only able to read it by visiting the Library of Congress, but it clarified some of the higher complexity <Pink>House Division</Pink> mathematics. The Astrological community owes him a great debt for preserving this knowledge.
